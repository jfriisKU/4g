/// Regardless, I have no idea what this function does.
/// It should return some sort of polygon length.
/// Really, it converts a float to an integer.

(*
 * I barely know what this function is supposed to do.
 * It should probably take the sum of the length of the vectors.
 * The vectors are defined as the cos and sin of times (?) in a circle.
 * They are then the length of the vectors between the neighbouring points.
 * What the neighbouring points are has yet to be discovered.
 * Please send microscope and math.
